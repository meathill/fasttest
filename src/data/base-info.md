## What affects my internet speed?

Your internet speed may vary from many different factors. Let's dive into these details below:

### Ethernet vs. Wi-Fi vs. Cellular network

Generally, an Ethernet network or fixed hard-wired connection will always beat Wi-Fi and Cellular network. However, many factors shared by all of them would cause your internet speed faster or slower. Here are some significant factors that would slow down your internet speed:

### Internet Service Provider (ISP)

Your internet speed would be stable and fast if you choose a famous brand ISP (for instance, Google Fiber and Xfinity in the U.S.). The subscription plan you choose is also a major factor. Usually, the more expensive plan would give you faster speed.

### Hardware

Sometimes, your device could be the reason why your internet lags. Old computers, laptops, tablets, mobile phones may have some issues connecting to modern networks. Outdated processors may slow down your internet speed a lot. And sometimes, you'd feel things got very laggy with these devices because of their low display refresh rate.

### Operation System / Proxy Settings

Don't forget to check your operation systems, especially the proxy settings. Turn off unnecessary proxy/VPN would boost your network speed. If you have to use a proxy, please make sure you don't send all the traffic through it if possible. For instance, if you're ISP blocks Youtube or Google, you need to send the traffic related to Youtube and Google via the Proxy.

### Browser / Application

Don't forget to check your browser and application versions and make sure you've upgraded them to the latest release. We highly recommend using Google Chrome, which has a majority market share and is frequently updated. Safari on macOS/iOS and Edge on Windows are also great.

It's pretty helpful to your speed if you can take advantage of the modern technologies created by those intelligent software engineers from Google, Apple, and those substantial internet companies.

### Network Traffic / Host Server

Please note that the network traffic and host server are two factors that are commonly ignored most of the time. Hosting websites or other web services is not free. Sometimes it can be costly if there're many people access the service. When the traffic is too high, and the website owner didn't pay enough money to run the service. The hosting companies will limit the speed or even terminate the service. That would make you feel slow on your side, and sometimes, you may even fail to open the page or load the service at all. It could happen a lot if you are visiting a small website maintained by individuals.

## What affects my Ethernet network speed?

Other than all the factors listed above. Ethernet network speed may vary to the cable and router. If your cable is very long, like more than 50 meters, your internet speed would also be affected.

Suppose you've subscribed to a costly service from your ISP service but have an inferior cable and router. Your internet speed would be very slow.

## What affects my Wi-Fi network speed?

The wireless router A/P plays a vital role in your Wi-Fi network condition. If your route can only transfer data in 300M bandwidth, your money is wasted when you subscribe to a 1000M ISP. So please choose a fast router if you have subscribed to a good service from your ISP.

The position of your router is also a key factor in your internet speed. In theory, Wi-Fi signals are capable of passing through walls and other obstacles. However, in reality, some walls are thicker and may block part of the signals. Wireless signals can easily penetrate materials such as drywall, plywood, and other kinds of wood.

## What affects my cellular network speed?

Your mobile phone is the key to cellular network speed. Say if you're using an outdated device, it may not support 4G or 5G. You will only have the 3G speed.

When you're moving very fast (for example, driving on the highway), the condition of your cellular network may also be unstable.
